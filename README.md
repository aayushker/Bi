What is a binary tree? <br>
Binary Tree is defined as a tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children. <br>
Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child. <br>

Binary Tree Representation
-----------------------------
A Binary tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node (commonly known as the “root”) of the tree. If the tree is empty, then the value of the root is NULL. 

Each node of a Binary Tree contains the following parts:
---------------------------------------------------------
Data <br>
Pointer to left child <br>
Pointer to the right child <br>

Basic Operation On Binary Tree:
---------------------------------
Inserting an element. <br>
Removing an element. <br>
Searching for an element. <br>
Traversing the tree. <br>

Auxiliary Operation On Binary Tree:
-------------------------------------
Finding the height of the tree <br>
Find the level of a node of the tree <br>
Finding the size of the entire tree. <br>

// How to Insert a value in a Binary Search Tree:
// A new key is always inserted at the leaf by maintaining the property of the binary search tree. We start searching for a key from the root until we hit a leaf node. Once a leaf node is found, the new node is added as a child of the leaf node.
// The below steps are followed while we try to insert a node into a binary search tree:
// Check the value to be inserted (say X) with the value of the current node (say val) we are in:
// If X is less than val move to the left subtree.
// Otherwise, move to the right subtree.
// Once the leaf node is reached, insert X to its right or left based on the relation between X and the leaf nodeâ€™s value.

// A utility function to insert

    // Otherwise, recur down the tree
    else if (key < node->data){
        node->left = insert(node->left,key);
    }
    else if (key > node->data){
        node->right = insert(node->right,key);

// A utility function to do inorder traversal of BST
void inorder(Node* node){
    if (node != NULL){
        inorder(node->left);

// Time Complexity: 
// The worst-case time complexity of insert operations is O(h) where h is the height of the Binary Search Tree. 
// In the worst case, we may have to travel from the root to the deepest leaf node. 
// The height of a skewed tree may become n and the time complexity of insertion operation may become O(n). 

// Auxiliary Space: The auxiliary space complexity of insertion into a binary search tree is O(1)
